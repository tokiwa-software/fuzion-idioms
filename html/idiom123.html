<h1>Idiom # 123: Assert condition</h1>

<p>See <a class="shylink" target="_blank" href="https://www.programming-idioms.org/idiom/123/assert-condition">programming-idioms.org</a>:</p>

Fuzion supports contracts via pre- and post-conditions. See:
<a href="https://flang.dev/tutorial/design_by_contract">Design by contract</a>

Invariants do (mostly) not make sense in Fuzion since use of mutable data is discouraged and should be avoided.

One possibility to emulate assert conditions is by calling a feature with a pre condition.
