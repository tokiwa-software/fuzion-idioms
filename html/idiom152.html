<h1>Idiom # 152: Turn a character into a string</h1>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Fuzion does not define a specific type for a character.
A <code>string</code> is a List of <code>codepoint</code>s that may be
represented using arbitrary encodings such as utf8.  A
single <code>codepoint</code> itself, however, is also a <code>string</code>, so
creating a <code>string</code> from a <code>codepoint</code> is the identity
operation.</p>

<p>A codepoint can be created from a unicode number given as
a <code>u32</code>, so <code>u32</code> can be considered Fuzion's equivalent
to a <code>char</code> type.</p>
