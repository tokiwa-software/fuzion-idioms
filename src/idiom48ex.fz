    Multi-line strings start and end with a fat quotation \""". They mostly work just like 'normal' strings but have the following peculiarities.

    * A multi-line string is required to start in the first line following the fat quotation.
    * The first line of the multi-line string is the reference for the indentation to be used throughout the rest of the string.
      Thus all lines of the multi-line strings have to indented at least as much as the first line.
    * A multi-line string may use interpolation with \$ and \{\} just like 'normal' strings.
    * Arbitrary nesting of multi-line strings is allowed.
    * Trailing white space in multi-line strings is disallowed.
    * For adding white space at the beginning of the first line or at the end of lines use escape codes described above.
    * Line terminators in multi-line strings are normalized to LF unless CR is explicitly included by using the escape code CR.

    There are two special escape sequences in multi-line strings. \
    A literal \\ followed by a literal line feed or a literal carriage return cancels the newline. \
    This is useful for splitting long strings over multiple lines in source code."""
